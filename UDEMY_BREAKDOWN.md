1. **for-loop** 
- The for loop is a fundamental construct in programming used to iterate over elements in a collection, such as na array or a string. It allows executing a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 
- There are different ways to implement a for loop in JavaScript, as demonstrated in the provided code snippet: 
- traditional for loop: 
`for(var i = 0; i < str.length; i++)` 
- for ... of loop 
`for(var char of str)`
